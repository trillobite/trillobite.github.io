#####jsonHTML Guide Copyright License v1.3 2016 Jesse Parnell


#####Summary:
The reason why I wrote this license, is so that anyone using my code can understand what they are making an agreement to, and what their rights are without having to go to a lawyer. All I ask is for you to utilize your brain, read this license as it is in context of the entire document, and do not try to stretch it's boundaries, as doing so may cause this license to be destroyed, and a newer one implemented with non-free restrictions... which would be sad, and terrible to the whole programming community. You must understand that my hand is forced into implementing any sort of license, people never want to be held accountable for their actions, politicians and governments have their agendas. People enjoy stealing your rights, this is an attempt to protect those rights. This license attempts to protect you and I, and anyone who helped to develop it. I would rather just throw my code out onto the web and let everyone do as they please with it, but that's not practical in the world that we live in today.

#####Copyright License:

v1.3

This software / code is provided to you similarly as Free Software, (refer to: https://gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html ), by using or obtaining this code, you have the Free Software basic rights that do not contradict this license, if any, and you defined as a user or consumer agree:

To hold the authors of this code as not responsible for any damages, or consequences of your malicious or "friendly" use of this code, or action taken by any interpretation of the documentation supplied. It is up to the consumer to ensure the integrity and effects of this code before it is run, copied, deleted, modified, or utilized in any way. This code is provided with no warranties, or guarantees. I ask from you to retain credit back to me if you use my code or any portion of it, [Easiest way to maintain credit is to simply add my trilobite mug signature, or a simple link to my github within your code] and leave this stated license intact and not modified. This code / software is regarded as an inanimate object, a tool, operating on natural laws, influenced by the current user and it's environment, any damage caused, by it's use or misuse even if resulting in any type of damage, you agree to hold the authors, contributors, and copyright holders of this entire project not repsonisble. The current user of the copy of this tool must be held responsible for the way they use it, and not hold reponsible the creators, distributors, or copiers of that tool. You may not redact, or modify this license within this repository / project / code / software, and leave the license fully, unmodified, as is, unless given written or verbal permission from the Copyright holder of this code / software. This license is not intended to cause a Closed-Source project to become Free Software, only the code and any portion of it from this project, under this license, has to remain Free, and it's source publicly availible, unless permission granted from the Copyright holder. This license is also not intended to be utilized as legal advice, the user/consumer must check with their local laws to make sure that an agreement with this license, and use of the works protected by this license, will not cause them to conflict with their local laws

Main Idea: You agree by downloading this work to hold me not responsible for whatever happens. You may view this code, and learn from it, and produce something similar, just if you make something and copy some of my code, you need to document it. I am allowing you to use my work free of charge, even if you are a corporation. All I am asking is that you pay for it by giving me credit, so if someone else likes my code, they can see who actually wrote it.

Without manipulation of this license, you may copy this license, and use it in your own code / software / projects / works, but, similarly, as stated above, you are responsible for the way you use the tools I created, including this license.

Feel free to fork, and ask to become a contributor, you have that right, if you have an improvement you implemented in your fork, that you believe is totally amazing, and should be included in the main project, I will review it, and possibly implement it, and give you credit as one of the authors or contributors. Remember, this license is also intended to protect you as an author or contributor.


#####Philosophy:
The "Keep it black" philosophy was arisen from the rebirth of the coffee shop culture, when one would ask if you wanted any sweeteners in your coffee, the correct response under this philosophy is, "No, keep it black." One who believes in this philosophy, finds that keeping the coffee black is the best way to experience the flavor in it's truest form, unspoiled by pesky sweeteners masking it's true nature. This same philosophy is now implemented into the code that I write, I try to keep it black, I only add fluff to the code where it's necessary, but other than that, any library I write under this philosophy is written to be as low level as possible and least intrusive to any programmer coming to try out the code I made. If you understand javaScript, there should be as small of a learning curve as possible to use my code, keeping it as true to it's roots as possible. 

I am still studying all of the different forms of Licensing which I can use. Be patient, my favorite one so far is the GNU public license, but before I release it with this license, I need to ensure that as the author of this code, I am not giving up any of my own valuable rights. Thank you for your patience.
