<h3>The Basics</h3>
First of all, you will still need to write a little bit of HTML to get started, you can utilize an existing web project, but for simplicity it's best to practice on a clean slate.

<div class="codeBox">
    <xmp>
        <html>
            <head>
                <title>jsonHTML EXAMPLE!</title>
                <script type='text/javascript' src='http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.min.js'></script> <!--MAKE SURE TO INCLUDE JQUERY-->
                <script type='text/javascript' src='jsonHTML.js'></script> <!-- MAKE SURE TO INCLUDE jsonHTML -->
            </head>
                <body></body>
        </html>
    </xmp>
</div>

<br/>
As of v0.6 and newer, you can now append directly to the body, this is one of two incompatibilities between v0.5 and v0.6. This "root" div can be any current div in the DOM, you may have to experiment to see exactly how your DOM will render, and make changes to css styling, luckily you can do that on the fly which will be covered later.
<br><br/>
Now, within the head tags, or within an external linked script, you can begin using jsonHTML, for this example, for simplicity, were going to place the code within the html in the head between script tags.

For the sake of simplicity, there is a jsonHTML constructor that you can call to quickly begin coding, it's called $jConstruct. This sets up an object that you can manipulate and have renderd to the DOM. If you dont like syntactic sugar, check out the documentation for v0.2 near the bottom of this documentation, v0.5.x is currently backwards compatible in that code style. Similar documentation is coming for v0.6+.

<div class="codeBox">
    <xmp>
        <script>
            //lets make a div that says hello world!
            var helloDiv = $jConstruct('div');
            helloDiv.text = 'Hello World';
        </script>
    </xmp>
</div>
