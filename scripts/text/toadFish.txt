<h3>Project toadFish</h3>
Documentation for the new experimental project code-named "toadFish," will arrive shortly. The code is complete and implemented into the project, I am simply working on seeing all of it's capabilities and best uses. You can gain a sneak peak into this project by downloading the github code package. Project toadFish example code is within this project already implemented. I still have more documentation work to do on other jsonHTML features. It takes time to produce a quality guide, so please be patient. "toadFish" will also be included within the next release, and I expect to pull the project out of beta very soon!
