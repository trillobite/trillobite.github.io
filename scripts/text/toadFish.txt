<h3>Project toadFish</h3>
Documentation for the new experimental project code-named "toadFish," will arrive shortly. The code is complete and implemented into the project, I am simply working on seeing all of it's capabilities and best uses. It takes time to produce a quality guide, so please be patient. "toadFish" will also be included within the next release, and I expect to pull the project out of beta very soon!
