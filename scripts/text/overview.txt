<h3>Introduction</h3>
<q>What is it?</q> Well, in order for me to explain that to you, I must first tell you
what it's not. jsonHTML is not a performance enhancer, it's not exactly a language,
it's not exactly a compiler, it's not exactly a library, so now you see why it's
so incredibly difficult to describe! I can tell you what it does, and how it is 
within purgatory, unable to be classified under any type of project, if anything,
you can say that it is a Language, a Compiler, and a code library at 17KB, all at
the same time! By the way, you are looking at it right now, this web page was developed
using jsonHTML.
<br><br/>

<q>Why was it created?</q> I created jsonHTML for a project at my work, we needed a web
GUI for our customers to be able to modify, and display their data on our SQL 
servers. As you may already know, there is no way to predict how much data is 
within a SQL table, they can vary in size wildly. If you want to display that data
on the web, typically you would have to use something like PHP, but that requires
more cpu cycles on our servers. jsonHTML takes what PHP would need to do, but has
it done on the client side, thus, creating something more like a Web App, very active
and fluid.
<br><br/>

<q>How does it do it, and what does jsonHTML stand for?</q> jsonHTML takes the jsonHTML
syntax, compiles it down to <f>JSON</f> first, just as a simple way to organize and sort
data for the rest of the compile process. Then once it goes to JSON, functions 
are parsed, stored in memory, div id's are generated or stored in hash tables,
then jsonHTML child objects are appended to their parent objects. Once everything
is put into memory, parsed, or executed, the remaining JSON is compiled down to 
<f>HTML5</f> spec objects. The HTML objects are managed extensively using jQuery, which
is one reason jsonHTML's syntax is strikingly similar to jQuery, this prevents
confusion and simplifies things for the programmer.

Before jsonHTML, to achieve the flexibility required for my projects, I had to write 
out the HTML as a string, and use jQuery to add them or manipulate them by parsing 
that string. This was tedious, especially compared to manipulating JSON objects as 
an abstraction layer. Basically put, by creating a JSON object to reflect what you 
want, jsonHTML takes your object and creates the string to pass to jQuery, then 
jQuery handles the rest. Think of jsonHTML as a compiler, or a jQuery shell, it 
takes javaScript (JSON) objects and compiles them down to HTML, where it is passed 
to jQuery, implemented into the DOM and the browser deals with them traditionally. 
It is also good to note, that if you are coming from a '.Net' environment to the 
Free Software society of the web, it may be easier to transition to the structured 
design of jsonHTML, rather than the fragmented world of developing for the web. 
jsonHTML definately helps to unify the common concepts of developing on the web, 
in an easy to use syntax.

If you are a more experienced programmer, you may notice that most of the example 
code below does not look like pure JSON, and in truth, you are correct! So why is 
this project called 'jsonHTML?' Basically, what you see below is due to the 
functionality that the $jConstruct contstructor gives you, without this you will 
have to write code in pure JSON. You can view the heart and soul of jsonHTML with 
the code examples near the bottom of this documentation.

So, if you would like to follow along, make sure to download the latest release, 
unpack, and give jsonHTML a try! It is assumed that you know the concepts of HTML, 
and javaScript. Having an understanding of jQuery is helpful, as jsonHTML largely 
depends on this library, but this understanding is not not mandatory. The 
documentation is still pretty basic as jsonHTML was not originally created to be 
released to the public, but as I moved the project to github, it became exposed to 
the public, and I have decided that it would be helpful to the free software 
coding community if my code was documented.
