<h3>Adding Events</h3>
There are two basic ways of implementing events in jsonHTML, one 
way, is to get the id and do your standard jQuery 
"$('#'+obj.id).click(function());" or you can implement the built 
in functionality which is typically easier to remember, and is more 
legible when code gets large and complex 
"myDivObj.event('click', function(){});" Either way works, it really 
depends on user preference.
<br></br>
Example using the more standard jQuery method:

<div class="codeBox">
    <xmp>
        var helloDiv = $jConstruct('div', {
            text: 'Hello World',
        }).addFunction(function() { //notice you have to add the jQuery event on click as a function, to be used after the object is appeneded, and rendered.
            $('#'+helloDiv.id).click(function() {
                console.log('i has click!');
            });
        });
    </xmp>
</div>

<br></br>
Example of the newer jsonHTML event implementation:

<div class="codeBox">
    <xmp>
        var helloDiv = $jConstruct('div', {
            text: 'Hello World',
        }).event('click', function() { //notice how the type of event is in quotes.
            console.log('i has click!');
        });
    </xmp>
</div>

<br></br>
As you can tell, there are not many differences between the two, this is why native 
event support in jsonHTML's custom syntax was implemented only recently; it was not 
very important. Basically the short-hand for implementing events, actually does the 
exact same thing as what is done at the top. In the background, the jQuery event is 
added as a function and later implemented after the object is appended. Any event 
that you can do in jQuery, you can do here, you simply name the event you need to 
use within the quotes which is supported by jQuery, and it will be used.

As an example, I have written a small, but more advanced code example with added functionality:

<div class="codeBox">
    <xmp>
        //Creating child object as a seperate var, may be more intuitive:
        var childTextBox = $jConstruct('textbox', {
            text: 'it is amazing!',
        }).css({
            'color': 'purple',
        });
        
        //Creating the parent object.
        var helloDiv = $jConstruct('div', {
            text: 'Hello World',
        }).textProperties('heading', '2').textProperties('bold').css({
            'width': '200px',
            'color': 'purple',
            'margin': '0 auto',
            'text-align': 'center',
            'border': '1px solid black',
            'border-radius': '15px', //I want the border to look pretty!
        }).event('click', function () { //when div is clicked...
            if(helloDiv.css().color == 'purple') { //if the current color is purple, change it to blue.
                helloDiv.css({
                    'color': 'blue',
                });
            } else {
                helloDiv.css({ //if it's not, change it back to purple.
                    'color': 'purple',
                });
            }
        }).addChild(childTextBox);   
        
        
        //first we want to wait until the DOM is finished rendering, we can use jQuery to do this.
        $(document).ready(function() {
            //now lets append helloDiv to the root div.
            helloDiv.appendTo('body');
        });
    </xmp>
</div>

Basically this example code changes the color of the text contained in the div, 
on click like a switch, on and off. You can see how using simple javaScript/jQuery 
tricks, you can access what the current color of the text in the div is, and 
change it according to your specifications on click.
